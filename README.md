# 🎓UCY-2nd-Year-Projects
This repository contains coding projects that I've completed during my 2nd (current) year of Computer Science studies at the University of Cyprus.

## EPL231 - Data Structures & Algorithms in Java
### Final Assignment: Tree Data Structures 🌲
> - **Description**: This project focuses on implementing two versions of the Trie data structure for managing a dictionary of words, with the aim of suggesting alternative words automatically. The assignment includes both functional implementation and a comparative analysis of memory efficiency for the two Trie variants. The primary objective is to explore the utility of Trie in word prediction mechanisms, such as text autocompletion in search engines.
> - **Grade**: To be announced...

## EPL232 - Programmic Techniques & Tools
### Assignment 1: Latin Square Game 🔢
> - **Description**: This program allows players to solve a Latin Square puzzle, adhering to the rules that each row and column must contain unique numbers from 1 to `size`, where `size` is the square's dimension.
> - **Grade**: 100/100

### Assignment 2: Chemical Formula Processor 🧬
> - **Description**: This project processes chemical formulas, expanding them into full molecular representations, validating parentheses, and calculating the total number of protons for each formula based on atomic numbers from the periodic table. Dynamic stacks are used to efficiently manage elements and parentheses while parsing the formulas.
> - **Grade**: 100/100

### Assignment 3: Automated Latin Square Game ⚙️
> - **Description**: This project consists of a Latin Square puzzle that is automatically played by a backtracking algorithm. The algorithm finds the first-in-order empty cell and places the first-in-order number that aadheres to the rules of the game. When no number can be placed, the algorithm backtracks to previous states of the tableau and finds a number, different from the one inserted before, to be placed in the tableau and continue from there.
